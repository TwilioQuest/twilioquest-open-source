# One More Time

## How do I find projects?

Deciding that you want to contribute to more open source projects is a great first step. But how do you find projects to work on?

If there are any tools, libraries, or other software projects you admire check their GitHub pages to see if they have any open issues. Most projects will welcome a Pull Request, but you should try to make sure they're still being actively maintained!

Another option if you have no ideas for a project to start on is to check out one of these curation sites. They use various different strategies to recommend different GitHub issues for you to tackle.

- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)
- [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending)
- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- [Your First PR](https://yourfirstpr.github.io/)
- [Awesome For Beginners](https://github.com/mungell/awesome-for-beginners)

Additionally, this is a [great longer guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) that gives in depth instruction on how to look for issues and communicate with open source maintainters effectively. It also talks about how writing code isn't the only way to help!

## I contributed, check my work!

If you've opened your next Pull Request and gotten it merged, its time to submit it to get your XP!

We will need three things from you that you should be able to find from the URL of your Pull Request.

- the user that owns the repository you contributed to
- the name of the repository you contributed to
- the number of the pull request you contributed with

For example, with the Open Pixel Art project that would've been:

- twilio-labs
- open-pixel-art
- <%= env.TQ_OPEN_PIXEL_ART_PR_NUMBER.value %>

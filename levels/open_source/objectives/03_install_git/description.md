# Git Set Up

To complete this challenge, you must [install the git command line tools](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your computer. After doing so, your terminal application (e.g. PowerShell or Terminal) should have access to a new command: `git`.

```bash
git --version
```

Once you have verified that `git` is installed and available on your [system path](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>), you'll need to let TwilioQuest know where `git` is located.

Paste in the **full path** to where the `git` command was installed on your computer. See the Help section if you aren't sure where to find that information. Paste the path in to the text field on the right, then click the _HACK_ button.
